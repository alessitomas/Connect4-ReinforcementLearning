# Connect4 Reinforcement Learning Project


## Project Objective

The main objective is to compare the performance of agents powerd by different RL agents such as (MinMax Q-Learning, DQN, and PPO) in the ConnectEnviroment. 

My goal is to implement agents using each one of these algorithms, evaluate there learning using cumulative reward visualizations, and evaluate their performance testing them against each other, and using the elo system provide by the environment.

## Results 

By the end I wish to have agents performance comparisons, and integrate with the environment to make it possible for users to play against my own agents implementations.
